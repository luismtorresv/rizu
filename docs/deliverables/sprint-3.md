### Risks and Possible Eventualities

> "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."
>
> —Murphy’s Law

The development and deployment of Rizu face several risks derived from the
team’s limited scale, the technical nature of the product, and the competitive
environment in which it operates.

#### Technical and Development Risks

Given that the team is composed of undergraduate students, there is a risk of
limited experience in advanced OpenStack configurations, production-level
security, and long-term maintenance. Integration errors or lack of testing
resources could lead to unstable releases or delayed delivery. Dependence on
open-source frameworks also implies exposure to external changes in APIs or
upstream versions that may disrupt functionality.

#### Financial and Resource Risks

As an early-stage student project, Rizu operates with scarce financial backing.
Insufficient capital could affect infrastructure costs, marketing efforts, or
support capacity. Delays in obtaining grants, sponsorships, or early customers
could threaten sustainability before reaching operational breakeven. Likewise,
the absence of full-time staff makes the project vulnerable to turnover or
graduation-related availability issues.

#### Market and Adoption Risks

OpenStack users represent a specialized and technically demanding audience. Many
organizations already rely on Horizon or have internal tools adapted to their
infrastructure. Rizu’s value proposition—simplicity and accessibility—may not be
sufficient to shift established user habits. There is also a risk of limited
visibility in the global market due to low marketing budgets and regional
constraints.

#### Operational and Legal Risks

Limited institutional backing may complicate formal contracting, intellectual
property registration, and compliance with data protection standards. Operating
in Colombia, where access to venture support and cloud infrastructure is still
developing, may restrict the ability to scale or form alliances with hosting
providers.

!!! note

    These risks are not necessarily detrimental if recognized early and managed
    through conservative planning, technical mentorship, and progressive release
    cycles.

### Conclusion on the Project's Viability

> “It is better to have a bad plan than no plan.”

> —Garry Kasparov, _How Life Imitates Chess_

From a technical standpoint, Rizu is viable. The team’s background in web
development and cloud deployment provides a sound foundation for building a
functional, minimal dashboard tailored to a defined user segment. The open-source
nature of OpenStack lowers entry barriers by allowing integration with existing
frameworks without major licensing costs.

Economically, the business plan projects short-term losses but demonstrates
positive growth within three years, reflecting a credible path to profitability
under modest operational expenses. The target market—small and medium
enterprises with existing hardware—reduces customer-side investment needs and
supports the feasibility of adoption.

Operationally, the plan remains feasible for a small team provided that workflow
automation, code maintainability, and customer support processes are
prioritized. Success depends on disciplined project management, consistent
testing, and gradual scaling of support operations.

While Rizu entails notable risks inherent to its scale and context, the project
is technically achievable, economically sustainable, and operatively manageable
within the proposed scope. With proper risk mitigation, it presents a realistic
opportunity for implementation and moderate commercial success.
