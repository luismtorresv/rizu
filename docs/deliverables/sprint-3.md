## In a nutshell

During this sprint we:

* Improved the aesthetics of the user interface
* Added block storage capabilities (think AWS EBS)
* Deployed the application (almost) using a Dockerfile
* Wrote a user manual to help onboard new users
* Conducted usability tests to determine UX quality
* Simplified the overall project setup workflow
