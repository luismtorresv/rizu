Rizu is a cloud console for a private cloud running on the OpenStack.
It's an alternative to the Horizon OpenStack dashboard with built-in support
for custom Terraform scripts.
The project's goal is to provide a streamlined introduction to cloud management
for people or staff that has no little to no experience.

Rizu was developed as an Integrative Project for a course at EAFIT University.
