     No AI notes this time 🙏.

- Jerónimo went through the product backlog.
- Jerónimo mentioned that the professor suggested we add container capabilities
  to our project.
- Jerónimo mentioned our planned visual redesign of the application.
- Luis mentioned we have to set up end-to-end tests using the Azure deployment
  we were using prior to the EAFIT DCA deployment.
- Jerónimo mentioned an issue related to SSH connections to the VM instances.
- León mentions the lack of clarity brought about by the professor's opinion on
  the scope and requirements of the initial proposal. (Hey, I'm just writing it
  down.)
- León prompted the team on what the plan for this sprint is. Jerónimo and him
  discussed object storage and databases, but settled on just containers.
- León asked the team whether they agree or not that the development team could
  have gotten farther using the already existing Horizon dashboard.
- León disagreed with the development team's decision to take on containers. His
  rationale is that containers can be easily deployed using VMs.
- Jerónimo mentioned that we will write down the user manual as a document.
