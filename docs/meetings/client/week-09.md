    The following is an AI-generated summary of the meeting based on the
    transcript.

## Project Progress and Division

* MVP divided into four modules: product creation, infrastructure
  (routers/networks), OpenStack feedback, and view-controller. Three completed,
  fourth in progress for delivery.
* Focus of sprint: infrastructure and prototypes, using Python SDK for OpenStack
  and Django for the interface. Terraform integration planned for next phase.
* Dashboard shows created infrastructure, project selection, and resource
  visualization.

## Interfaces: API vs Terraform

* Both options to coexist: API/manual interface for testing and learning,
  Terraform for production and scalability.
* Alternatives discussed: keep API and Terraform separate, build custom language
  transpiling to Terraform, or develop Terraform provider (already exists).
* Consensus: focus on integration and usability rather than academic exercises.
  Platform should help users start simply and transition to Terraform.

## Market Segmentation

* Target users: developers seeking low-cost Platform as a Service solutions.
* Defined positioning toward affordable development-oriented services.

## Follow-up

* Share questions, screenshots, and progress updates via WhatsApp for review by
  Leon Jaramillo.
