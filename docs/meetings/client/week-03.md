## Purpose

On Tuesday, July 29, the Rizu work team met with Softserve representative Leon
Jaramillo to discuss the requirements and details of the proposed challenge for
Integrative Project 2.

## Meeting schedule

The first item discussed was the meeting schedule. The team and Leon agreed that
all future meetings would take place on Tuesdays at 2:30 PM. These meetings will
be held weekly, at least during the first phase of the project (future dates may
change). Meeting durations will vary but are expected to average around 30
minutes. The meeting topics will also change, and Leon intends to bring
different Softserve members to provide feedback. The purpose of this format is
to prepare for an eventual presentation of the project to Softserve.

## Cloud deployment

After addressing formalities, the meeting shifted to a discussion about cloud
deployment models. We discussed the various approaches used historically:
on-premises/local infrastructure, cloud, and hybrid. Leon explained the
advantages and disadvantages of each model and how we could apply those lessons
to our project.

## Requirements

Regarding requirements, the team discussed with Leon the specifications the
private cloud should meet. The key components to be provided include: Virtual
Machines (VMs, Containers), Storage, Databases (DB), Networking, and Continuous
Delivery (Pipeline). Therefore, the solution must inherently be Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS). In other words, the solution should offer services
accessible in a manner similar to a public cloud.

## Open-source projects

To that end, Leon recommended that we look into previous/similar solutions and
analyze how they addressed the discussed topics. Additionally, he suggested
using open-source software such as OpenStack or CNCF technologies as the
foundation for the project.
