## Purpose

On Tuesday, August 5, the Rizu work team met with SoftServe representative Leon
Jaramillo to showcase the progress done so far during Sprint 0.

## OpenTofu vs Terraform

León suggested we use OpenTofu instead of Terraform, as the latter is going
through complex licensing changes.

## Python

Jerónimo brought up the potential use of Python scripts, but León dismissed
it as he's more interested in using existing tools.

## Market research

Jerónimo and Paula presented their research on existing tools for setting up
private clouds.
Among those were OpenStack and Apache CloudStack.

## Color palette and logo

León prompted us to use a logo of our own, not the company's.
However, he suggested we base our color palette on that of SoftServe's.

## "Homework"

León wants us to look into the architecture of popular cloud computing providers
such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and Oracle.
