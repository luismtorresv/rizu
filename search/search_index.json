Sebastian, Paula Ines) agreed to refactor   the project to meet integrator requirements, designing a new architecture   based on Django and OpenStack with Terraform integration.</li> <li>Jeronimo explained the previous project didn\u2019t meet requirements, so the team   will build a Django dashboard for students with limited cloud knowledge,   integrating Terraform scripts to create private clouds in OpenStack.</li> <li>Proposed architecture: client-server model, with a monolithic server hosting   OpenStack projects and the Django dashboard, with possible server separation   for security and robustness (Luis Miguel, Jeronimo).</li> <li>Luis Miguel confirmed an existing repository can be reused. Roles were   distributed: each member will take user stories, Paula Ines focusing on   frontend design (CSS, Bootstrap).</li> <li>Development will begin in Django, with tasks distributed and all members   researching technical topics, especially Terraform\u2013OpenStack integration.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"meetings/weeklies/week-07/#professor-feedback","title":"Professor Feedback","text":"<ul> <li>Luis Miguel and Jeronimo reviewed professor\u2019s suggestions on installation   simplicity, permission management, hardware changes, and Terraform use.   Actions were set to clarify and align project with feedback.</li> <li>Installation should be simple: team will explore automation of OpenStack and   app deployment via Bash or Python scripts.</li> <li>Django includes permission handling; team will study documentation for proper   integration in the dashboard.</li> <li>On hardware modification: team concluded this likely refers to changing   instance resources in OpenStack. Jeronimo will confirm with professor.</li> <li>Terraform recommended for private cloud creation: team will explore   Django\u2013OpenStack API connection followed by Terraform script execution.

Decision aligned with professor\u2019s recommendation to prioritize   Terraform.</li> <li>Juan Sebastian tasked with investigating Terraform\u2019s capabilities in OpenStack   (subnets, VMs, storage, authentication, script execution).</li> <li>Team discussed user interface: whether users could edit generated Terraform   scripts directly or through a simplified interface.
